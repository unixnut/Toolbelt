# Description:
#
# In simple terms, Toolbelt is a mid-level provisioning/orchestration tool
# that stops you having to care as much about the dependencies of your work.
#
# Toolbelt can install three major kinds of things:
#   + A "tool" is a first-order, executable program that can be run from the
#     command-line.  Toolbelt knows how to find tools and (in many cases) knows
#     what versions have been installed, and can remove them.
#     A tool can be installed for the whole system or a given user.
#   + Projects are custom, individual pieces of work that each reside in a given
#     directory.  They are based on a "template", which is a starting group of
#     files and subdirectories (installed by Toolbelt) that is then built on
#     by the user and (usually) committed to a source control repository.
#   + "Components" are discrete, 3rd-party group of files and subdirectories
#     that form part of a project.  They (mostly) differ from project templates
#     in that they are usually installed into a project after it has already
#     been started.  They are also used as-is by the project, i.e. not modified
#     or extended.
#   + A "rider" is a user-defined set of additional stuff that is installed
#     whenever a given tool, template or component is installed.  This can
#     include configuration information, files, extra components, complimentary
#     tools, etc.
#
# Toolbelt proudly uses cookiecutter and language/framework-specific package
# managers (like pip, npm or Composer) to do much of the heavy lifting.  In
# many cases Toolbelt's value-add comes from centrally recording things about
# projects or components.  In general, Toolbelt hopes to add extra security
# to the installation process where practical.
#
# The main philosophy underlying Toolbelt is that you don't need to care what
# language a tool is written in.  It allows you to break out of the silos you
# are placed in by various language-specific package managers and just install
# something without having to remember how, or search for instructions on the
# World Wide Web.  It is designed to interact sensibly with your OS's package
# manager, given that uses its package archives unless there is a newer version
# of a tool available from upstream, in which case it asks you if you want to
# use that instead.  (Please note that if you do, you are then responsible for
# your own security updates.)
#
# A secondary philosophy is that you have multiple projects and that these will
# use a variety of project templates and components, which you'll want to
# manage centrally; Toolbelt does this in an opinionated way that allows a
# greater focus on security.
#
# Internally, Toolbelt refers to "entities" instead of tools, because the
# former can also consist of dependencies like OS package archives.

#
# TO-DO
#   + 'remove' subcommand
#   + "gem:" "pip:" etc. prefixes with auto-dependencies
#   + Record things installed (that aren't OS packages)
#   + Record dependencies installed
#   + Check for things before installing
#   + Detect new versions
#   + 'upgrade' subcommand (applies to everything installed by default)
#   + Flag dependencies that are OS packages as automatically installed
#   + 'tidy' subcommand for removing unused dependencies
#   + 'stamp' subcommand for creating a project from a well-known template
#     with cookiecutter (also records an alias for faster use later)
#   + 'add' subcommand for adding a component to a given project
#   + 'register' subcommand for recording the location of a given project
#   + subcommand for surveying components of registered projects for updates
